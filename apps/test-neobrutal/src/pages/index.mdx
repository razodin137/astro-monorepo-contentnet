# Start Building Your Vision

This is the default landing page for your new site. It's an **MDX** file, which means you can use Markdown for content and also import powerful components.

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Edit `package.json` to set your site's **name** and **title**.
2. Configure your Ghost tag in the `siteConfig`.
3. Customize `src/styles/theme.css` to match your brand.

### ✨ What's included in this template?

- **Ghost Integration**: Your blog posts are automatically fetched on the [/blog](/blog) page.
- **MDX Support**: Use JSX components inside your content.
- **Shared UI**: Access a centralized library of headers, footers, and cards.
- **CSS Theming**: Control the entire look via CSS variables.
