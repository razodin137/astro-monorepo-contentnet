## A Modern Astro Starter

This theme is designed to give you a solid foundation for building beautiful, high-performance websites with Astro.

### Key Principles

- **Simplicity First**: No complex build configurations. Just CSS variables and clean components.
- **Performance Focused**: Static site generation means your pages load instantly.
- **Developer Friendly**: Clear file structure and well-documented code.

### Theming Made Easy

All visual customization happens through CSS variables in `src/styles/theme.css`. Want to change the primary color? Just update one variable:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #your-color;
}
```

   - Header with responsive navigation

   - Content cards
   - Form elements

2. **Ready-to-Use Layouts**

   - Markdown layout for content pages

3. **Ghost CMS Integration**

   - Zero configuration required

> "The best code is no code at all. The second best is code that you don't have to maintain."
